## 0.6.0

### request.path_params

The biggest change here is that endpoint signatures are no longer:

```python
async def func(request: Request, **kwargs) -> Response
```

Instead we just use:

```python
async def func(request: Request) -> Response
```

The path parameters are available on the request as `request.path_params`.

This is different to most Python webframeworks, but I think it actually ends up
being much more nicely consistent all the way through.

### app.url_for(name, **path_params)

Applications now support URL reversing with `app.url_for(name, **path_params)`.

### app.routes

Applications now support a `.routes` parameter, which returns a list of `[Route|WebSocketRoute|Mount]`.

### Route, WebSocketRoute, Mount

The low level components to `Router` now match the `@app.route()`, `@app.websocket_route()`, and `app.mount()` signatures.
