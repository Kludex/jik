- [ ] I understand that this PR may be closed in case there was no previous discussion. (This doesn't apply to typos!)
- [ ] I've added a test for each change that was introduced, and I tried as much as possible to make a single atomic change.
- [ ] I've updated the documentation accordingly.
- [ ] I've added a note on the `docs/release-notes.md` about my changes (changes on documentation or type annotations don't need this).
